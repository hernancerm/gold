# gold

Gold is a tool written in Zsh for golden testing on stdout/stderr of commands.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>All pass</th>
    <th>One passes, one fails</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img src="./media/all_pass.png"></th>
    <th><img src="./media/pass_fail.png"></th>
  </tr>
</table>

## Features

- Name test cases for easy identification in the output.
- Declarative approach, leveraging a Zsh file to provide configuration and resource files.
- Can be used to test software written in any language. The output of the binaries is what is tested.
- When a test case does not pass, the diff is nicely displayed using [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta).
- Patch the golden file of test cases currently not passing.

## Requirements

- `zsh` — <https://zsh.sourceforge.io>
  - In macOS this should already be installed.
- `delta` (optional) — <https://github.com/dandavison/delta>

## Installation

Execute the script [install.zsh](./install.zsh):

```
source install.zsh
```

```text
cp -v gold /usr/local/bin
```

## Usage

Print the below message with `gold --help`. This is the public API.

```text

  gold (--version|-v)
    Display the version.

  gold <config-file> <sub-command>
    <config-file>
      Config file path, written in Zsh, which must define the following parameters:
        - `test_cases`. Numerically indexed array with the name of the test cases. This allows gold
           to know how many test cases should be executed and provides a tag to print for each test.
        - `resources`. Holds the file path to a dir to provide data for the command. At a minimum,
           it is expected that for each test case there is one golden file in this directory with
           the name `<index>_golden.txt`.
        - `command`. Command to execute which output is compared against a golden file. The file can
           be any valid Zsh command. Two strings are replaced before executing the command: <R> with
           the `resources` value and <I> with the test case index (indices begin at 1).
    <sub-command>
      - list: List all test cases.
      - run-all: Run all test cases.
      - run <test-case-index>: Run a single test case, by index.
      - execute <test-case-index>: Execute the command corresponding to a test case, by index.
      - patch-all: Patch (fix with current diff output) all test cases.
      - patch <text-case-index>: Patch (fix with current diff output) a single test case, by index.
```

For an example usage, refer to the directory [test](./test).

Example configuration run: `./gold test/pass_fail/config.zsh run-all`.
